# PHP - Hypertext Preprocessor

## Overview

PHP, which stands for "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor," is a widely-used open-source scripting language designed for web development. Originally created by Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994, PHP has evolved into one of the most popular server-side programming languages.

## Features

- **Server-Side Scripting:** PHP is mainly used for server-side scripting, allowing the execution of code on the server before the result is sent to the client's web browser.

- **Embedding in HTML:** PHP code is often embedded directly within HTML, making it easy to mix dynamic content with static content.

- **Cross-Platform:** PHP is platform-independent and runs on various operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.

- **Database Integration:** PHP seamlessly integrates with databases, allowing developers to interact with databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and others.

- **Extensive Library Support:** PHP has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks that simplify common tasks, such as database manipulation, file handling, and more.

## Getting Started

To start using PHP, you need a server environment where PHP is installed. Many web servers come with PHP support by default. You can install PHP manually or use pre-configured packages like XAMPP, WampServer, or MAMP for local development.
